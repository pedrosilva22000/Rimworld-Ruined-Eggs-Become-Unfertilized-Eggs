# Rimworld-Ruined-Eggs-Become-Unfertilized-Eggs

A Mod for Rimworld.

Transforms ruined eggs by temperature into unfertilized eggs, for eggs that don't have unfertilized counterparts this mod also creates them with c#, so ALL eggs will be converted.

What is the difference between this and Animals Logic or Ruined Is Unfertilized?
-Animals Logic will convert all eggs into unfertilized chicken eggs instead of their original egg;
-Ruined Is Unfertilized only converts the eggs that have an unfertilized counterpart, so some eggs will just stay as fertilized (ruined by temperature).

Compatibility?
-If you have Animals Logic uncheck "convert eggs ruined by temperature" on the mod options;
-Not compatible with Ruined Is Unfertilized;
-Should be compatible with all other mods.

Safe to add mid save.
Can be removed mid save but it's NOT recommended.

NOT COMPATIBLE WITH 1.5, Rimworld Vanilla 1.6 fixes the original problem.
